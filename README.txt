Here is some helpful information for this workshop. I've organized information by
workshop to better organize the materials. Workshop1 doesn't exist because we followed
the Oomlaut Workshop Manual to help us setup our Arduino environments.

Source for Manual/Experiments that we'll be performing in these workshops is found at:

Parts can be found quite cheaply at the following sites:

For really obscure parts and components:

If you have any challenges while you're working on the experiments on your own, I encourage you to send an email to The Learned Nerd (TLN) mailing list at tln@posterous.com. I'm on the list as well as many others who have a lot of experience. Also, TLN has regular meetups Wednesday night and Saturday afternoon. You can subscribe to the mailing list to get notifications about each meeting. (You might be required to join Posterous to email/subscribe, I'm not sure. Please email me if you have challenges.)

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Q: Will my Arduino X be okay for the workshop?
A: All of the Arduinos located at http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Hardware are supported by the IDE. Some of the models will not work with experiments because functionality may be missing. To be safe, the following models have been used with the experiments and are recommended:

 - Arduino Uno (any revision)
 - Arduino Mega (any version/revision)
 - Arduino Duemilanove

 Q: What do I need to participate in the workshop experiments?
 A: At the bare minimum, you just need a laptop which can run the IDE located at http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software. Oh, and it should have a USB port.

    We have a limited number of these items which you can borrow during the workshop but must return before you go home. If you plan to participate often, I recommend getting a these online at one of the sites above or from your local Radio Shack.

	- Arduino Uno R3
	- Breadboard
	- Basic components (resistors, LEDs, hookup wire...)

   We will always provide the parts for the current workshop and expect that they'll be returned in reasonable condition for future workshops.
