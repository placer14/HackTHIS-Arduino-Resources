If you have any challenges while you're working on the experiments on your own, I encourage you to send an email to The Learned Nerd (TLN) mailing list at tln@posterous.com. I'm on the list as well as many others who have a lot of experience. Also, TLN has regular meetups Wednesday night and Saturday afternoon. You can subscribe to the mailing list to get notifications about each meeting. (You might be required to join Posterous to email/subscribe, I'm not sure. Please email me if you have challenges.)
