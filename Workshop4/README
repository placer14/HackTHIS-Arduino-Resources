HackTHIS: Arduino
Workshop 4

Today we'll be driving motors!

In today's experiment, we'll be hooking up our motor to an electrical current. We can follow the instructions located at http://www.oomlout.com/oom.php/products/ardx/circ-03. (This is experiment #3 in our Experimentor's Guide PDF.)

After you're able to get the first circuit working, there's extra credit for you to try! We'll be building a circuit commonly used to control motors called an H-bridge. An H-bridge allows the direction of the motor to be controlled without switching the direction of the current manually. This experiment follows the directions at the end of experiment #11 in our Experimentor's Guide PDF. But instead of looking there, see if you can build it from the circuit diagram included in this folder. (Called h-bridge.png) For more information about H-Bridges, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-bridge.s

Extra notes:

In this experiment, we use a diode (similar to an LED, but without the light) in a particular application commonly called a "Flyback Diode". For more information about this, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyback_diode

If you want to get the parts yourself:
Sparkfun has all of them except the relay.

The relay (part #PB987-ND) I got from Digikey:
